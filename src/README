To compile this program, set your working directory so that the challenge directory is visible and use javac:

% javac challenge/Challenge.java

In the same directory, run the program by passing your data file as the last argument:

% java challenge.Challenge /tmp/my_word_list

This program assumes that word list will be a new-line delimited text file. You should see output like this:


% java challenge.Challenge /tmp/my_word_list
